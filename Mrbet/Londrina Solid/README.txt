The Londrina super family is composed of 4 family styles: Londrina Solid, [Londrina Shadow](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Londrina+Shadow), [Londrina Outline](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Londrina+Outline), and [Londrina Sketch](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Londrina+Sketch). You can combine the main style, Solid, with the others to create different effects. The origins of the Londrina typeface project is in the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil: Urban confusion. Initially I designed the "New Folk" for use in a poster, with only uppercase letters. I saw at the start some potential for a typeface that could recall the feelings of the writing used day-to-day in my city's informal communication, and developed it into a typeface family with lowercases too. This is the Londrina Outline member of the Londrina family.
